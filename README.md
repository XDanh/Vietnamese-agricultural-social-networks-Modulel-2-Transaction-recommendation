# Introduction
The system "Vietnam Agricultural Social Network - Module 1: Trading Platform"
was proposed with the aim of developing the agricultural sector in our country. Thanks to
the connection between sellers and buyers, the search for supply and demand has become
simpler. However, nding suitable transactions for both sellers and buyers is still a problem
that the system has not yet solved. Therefore, the topic "Vietnam Agricultural Social
Network - Module 2: Trading Recommendation" is proposed.
The "Vietnam Agricultural Social Network - Module 2: Transaction Recommendation"
topic is proposed with the aim of connecting sellers and buyers in a non-random way. The
method of connection is to propose products to buyers and propose buyers to sellers.
Proposals for buyers are calculated based on the evaluation criteria of buyers for
products provided by the system and products are ranked according to the criteria set by
the system.
Proposals for sellers are calculated based on the evaluation criteria of sellers for
buyers and buyers are ranked according to the criteria set by the system.
The recommendation function is built using the PHP scripting language (Personal
Home Page) in combination with Laravel framework version 9.0 and the Neo4j database
management system. Comes with programming languages JavaScript, HTML, â€¦
